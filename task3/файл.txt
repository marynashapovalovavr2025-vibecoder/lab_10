Chorus]
Let it unfold
Will howling tides give me something to hold
On to my life when I've sunken so low
Over the end of the vortex we took every breath to follow
Where do we go?
Where do we end up when we save the world?
Truth in the shadows so brightened in gold
Place our fate into the ones aren't in control

[Verse 1]
Stop, a couple things undue
Drop the fight and let it follow through
Freeze just for a sеc or two
Breathe again in the world anеw
I guess that there was never such a thing
Like everything's meant to be
But I'mma win this silly game
Until then I will never leave

[Verse 2]
Take back all my regrets
And camouflage it like your silhouette
Time is like music
Play it 'til the end and then reset
Knowing it all, am I destined to fall?
Like once you did for me

[Reversed Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Back to me
I know that you can track it back to me
No matter who, and what, and when intertwined, dive back in time
The truth will remember our legacy
Wasn't it hard to follow?
I'd do it again tomorrow
It drag me down, and drag me down
Maybe we'll never leave

[Verse 4]
Like trying to bend water
Why would you even bother
Time is like music
Now you know I've got to kill it
Wanting it all
And the whole world will crumble and fall, woah

[Chorus]
Let it unfold
Will howling tides give me something to hold
On to my life when I've sunken so low
Over the end of the vortex we took every breath to follow
Where do we go?
Where do we end up when we save the world?
Truth in the shadows so brightened in gold
Place our fate into the ones

[Outro]
I've held promises unbroken
Even when the night has fallen
Shattered mirrors our reflection
Should you keep the light on reason?
I've held promises unbroken (Ooh)
Shattered mirrors our reflection
Let it un', let it un', let it un', let it unfold
